ðŸŸ¦ Slide 1: Problem Statement
Level One
Managing dependencies across large projects is messy, redundant, and hard to scale.

Level Two
Challenges faced in real development workflows:

â€¢ High redundancy due to repeated or unused libraries
â€¢ Manual tracking of dependencies is error-prone and time-consuming
â€¢ No system-wide visibility into dependency usage across repositories
â€¢ Absence of categorization limits auditability and optimization
â€¢ Risk of bloat, version conflicts, and unnecessary transitive inclusion

ðŸŸ¦ Slide 2: Objective
Level One
Automate and standardize dependency analysis across Maven-based repositories.

Level Two
Goals of the ASPEN Dependency Analysis tool:

â€¢ Analyze repositories using pom.xml and Maven CLI
â€¢ Identify unused or redundant declared dependencies
â€¢ Classify libraries into meaningful functional categories
â€¢ Provide project-wide and repository-level insights
â€¢ Integrate with Bitbucket, enable refresh, and support cross-team usage

ðŸŸ¦ Slide 3: Tech Stack
Level One
Tools and technologies used:

Level Two
Core Technologies
â€¢ Python (Backend Logic)
â€¢ Streamlit (UI and Interaction Layer)
â€¢ Maven CLI (dependency:tree, analyze)
â€¢ Oracle SQL Developer (8-table schema)

Level Two
Ecosystem & Integration
â€¢ Bitbucket (Repo Fetching with Auth)
â€¢ OpenShift + Harness (CI/CD pipeline)
â€¢ SonarQube + PyTest (Testing and Static Analysis)

ðŸŸ¦ Slide 4: Proposed Solution
Level One
Architecture (End-to-End Workflow)

â€¢ User inputs CSI App ID and selects mode
â€¢ DB is checked for existing analysis
â€¢ If not found or force-refresh triggered â†’ Git clone repo
â€¢ Run Maven commands â†’ extract direct dependencies
â€¢ Classify libraries based on rule-based engine
â€¢ Compute repo/project metrics and store results in DB
â€¢ Display metrics or suggestions via Streamlit

Level One
Key Features

Level Two
Classification
â€¢ Rule-based engine using keyword heuristics
â€¢ 30+ functional categories (JSON, DB, Testing, etc.)
â€¢ Extensible structure with fallback category ("Unknown")

Level Two
Analysis Modes
â€¢ Project-Level: Aggregates metrics across all repos under project key
â€¢ Repo-Level: Individual repo insights with library sizes and suggestions

Level Two
Refresh Support
â€¢ Smart caching with force-refresh option (within 10 minutes)
â€¢ Prevents redundant analysis and minimizes DB churn

ðŸŸ¦ Slide 5: Demo
Level One
Demonstrating key capabilities of the tool

Level Two
Screenshots (static in slides + shown live):

â€¢ Repository selection with project key input
â€¢ Project-wide category-wise library breakdown (size, frequency)
â€¢ Repo-specific suggestions for unused dependencies
â€¢ Force-refresh logic and cache-aware notifications
â€¢ Bitbucket auth + analysis logs

ðŸŸ¦ Slide 6: Challenges and Learning
Level One
Technical and Design Challenges

Level Two
â€¢ Handling Maven output parsing across inconsistent repo structures
â€¢ Reducing false positives in keyword-based classification
â€¢ Designing a reusable schema for cross-repo metrics
â€¢ Managing refresh vs cache logic without hitting performance bottlenecks

Level One
Key Learnings

Level Two
â€¢ Built scalable backend pipelines integrated with Bitbucket
â€¢ Developed modular, extensible classification and analysis logic
â€¢ Learned practical CI/CD tooling (OpenShift, Harness)
â€¢ Enhanced backend testing and coverage through SonarQube and unit tests
â€¢ Focused on engineering for long-term reusability, not just a one-off script
